RULES AND REGULATIONS

•Each Team or player is assigned a color coin and can only pocket that color coin.

•Pocketing the queen must be followed by pocketing another coin on the same strike.

•The red 'queen,' can be pocketed at any time after sinking your first piece but must be sunk before your last one. After pocketing the queen, you must sink one of your carrommen, thereby'covering'it, into any pocket in the next shot, or she is returned to the center spot.

•Once the queen is covered, whoever clears all their carrom men first wins the 'board'.
